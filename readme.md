## Chrome Tabs snapshot
***
As a developer we always like to keep all the tabs open in browser till the work is done or you finished reading a new topic or till you try a hands on blog page. 

I build this extension to help me with keeping track of my tabs
* Take a snapshot of your current browser tabs
* Close all the tabs and move on to new things
* Come back and open all or specific tabs from your saved snap.

This helps me a lot to keep my tabs clean and save RAM in system.
